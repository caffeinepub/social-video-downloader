  "summary": "The implementation includes a frontend with URL input validation for Instagram and Facebook, backend functions to fetch video links, download functionality, and a modern interface with a non-blue/purple color scheme. However, the backend logic appears incomplete or non-functional for actual video extraction, and watermark removal is not explicitly demonstrated.",

      "requirement": "Backend extracts video content from Instagram without watermarks",
      "reason": "The backend function getInstagramDownloadLink makes a simple HTTP request to Instagram's API endpoint, but there is no evidence of actual video extraction logic, watermark removal processing, or proper parsing of Instagram's response format. The frontend attempts to parse responses, but the backend does not implement the extraction.",
